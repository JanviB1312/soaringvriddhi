    India is one of the major players in the agriculture sector
    worldwide and it is the primary source of livelihood for ~55%
    of India’s population. India has the world&#39;s largest
    cattle herd (buffaloes), the largest area planted for wheat,
    rice, and cotton, and is the largest producer of milk, pulses,
    and spices in the world. It is the second-largest producer of
    fruit, vegetables, tea, farmed fish, cotton, sugarcane, wheat,
    rice, cotton, and sugar. The agriculture sector in India holds
    the record for second-largest agricultural land in the world
    generating employment for about half of the country’s
    population.

    Thus, farmers become an integral part of the sector to provide
    us with a means of sustenance. Consumer spending in India will
    return to growth in 2021 post the pandemic-led contraction,
    expanding by as much as 6.6%. The Indian food industry is
    poised for huge growth, increasing its contribution to world
    food trade every year due to its immense potential for value
    addition, particularly within the food processing industry.
    The Indian food processing industry accounts for 32% of the
    country’s total food market, one of the largest industries in
    India and is ranked fifth in terms of production, consumption,
    export and expected growth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Foodgrain production in India touched 330.5 million metric
    tonnes (MT) in 2022-23 (3rd Advance Estimate). India is the
    world’s 2nd largest producer of food grains, fruits and
    vegetables and the 2nd largest exporter of sugar. A total of
    521.27 LMT rice has been anticipated for procurement for the
    upcoming KMS 2023-24, up from 496 LMT produced during the
    previous KMS 2022-23.

    With cutting-edge technologies such as AI, ML, IoT and
    blockchain, India&#39;s education sector will redefine itself
    in the years to come. It has also embraced the Education 4.0
    revolution, which promotes inclusive learning and increased
    employability. The government has implemented policies like
    the NEP, which will be fully implemented over the course of
    this decade starting from 2021-22 and will have a strong focus
    on high-quality vocational education
